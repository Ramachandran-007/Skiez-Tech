        Many people presently have a dream of working at home and being their own boss or ruling their own world. Working from home offers a comfortable place for people in the modern workforce.<br><br> 
        The recent covid-19 pandemic brought major changes in business and people's lives. Surprisingly, the truth is that workers were capable to maintain or improve business productivity even working from home was revealed. This made a noteworthy shift, as business managers’ were also allowed to relax working hours. Working from home at the present is an appealing career move.<br><br>
        Both working from home and working from the office offer equal advantages as well as disadvantages. In this blog, we can see some advantages of working from home and working from an office.<br><br>

        <h4>Reduced travelling time</h4><br>
        One of the major benefits people can gain from working from home is the removal of travelling time. On average, Indian people spend a minimum of 2 to 3 hours a day, travelling to their office and from work. This process not only wastes time but they could possibly spend effectively, it also greatly hinders the work-life balance.<br><br>
        If a person works a regular time hour from morning 9 to evening 5 (or 6) depending upon their office job and they are spending almost 7% of their day in heavy traffic, it is natural for people to feel stressed and feel like their life is fully covered with work. Though, when your work can be completed in a stress-free environment, it does not seem as awkward as before.<br><br>
        
        <h4>Better work-life balance</h4><br>

Furthermore, an inflexible work schedule in the office can cause workers to hate work rather easily.<br><br> 
        This is the main reason that most employers who afford their employees with the work from home option since it also provides them the easiness to choose their own working hours, which denotes that workers can begin and stop their daily work as they prefer, as long as their work is finished quickly and leads to better results. Thus having control over your work schedule and when it comes to achieving the desires of your personal life is good.<br><br>
        
        <h4>Working from home saves money</h4><br>

Additionally, employees working from home option can have the chance to take fewer sick days and this is a nice concept to take care of their health.<br><br>
